ok fastest place to get this up online?

1:08 PM
For a simple spec/landing page to establish presence fast:

Vercel + Next.js — deploy in under 10 minutes, free tier, custom domain easy to attach. Just push to GitHub and it's live.

If you want even faster with zero code: Notion public page or Typedream — drag-drop, looks clean, shareable link immediately.

What are you actually trying to put up — landing page, the SwarmStore spec doc, something else? That changes the answer a bit.

I want a landing page to get peoplet's ttention, but I need to find a way to implement this fast

Read the skill file first to make sure I build this right.

Given LUMARA and SwarmStore are about trust, privacy, and AI companions — I'm thinking a dark, editorial aesthetic. Feels premium, not hype-y. Distinctive without screaming "AI startup."

Let me build this now.


Created a file, read a file
Created a file, read a file
Dark editorial aesthetic — warm gold/red on near-black, serif headlines, orbital animation in the hero, scroll-reveal sections. Covers:

Hero with the core "AI that waits for you" positioning
Manifesto section laying out the trust argument
Product cards for LUMARA and SwarmStore
Four principles
Comparison table (implicitly against OpenClaw without naming them)
Waitlist form
To get it live in under 10 minutes: Drop the HTML file into Vercel by dragging it into a new project, or push it to a GitHub repo and connect. Free, instant, custom domain attachable. No framework needed — it's a single HTML file.

I meant a landing page for swarmstore, not orbitalai

3:42 PM
Got it. Let me redo this focused entirely on SwarmStore — the plugin marketplace for AI agents.

Quick question before I build:

what do you recommend?

3:43 PM
For where SwarmStore sits right now — pre-launch, needing to build a community — I'd go developers first. They're the ones who'll build the plugins that make the marketplace real, and they talk. Get 50 excited developers and they'll bring the consumers.

For the hook, runtime discovery is the genuinely novel thing. "The App Store for AI agents" is a decent analogy but everyone's using it. "Your agent figures out what it needs and goes and gets it" — that's the actual new behavior, and no one else is saying it clearly.

So: developer-facing, runtime discovery as the lead, with the trust/curation angle as the why you'd use SwarmStore over rolling your own.

Q: Good to go with that direction?
A: Yes, build it

3:44 PM

Reading frontend design skill
Reading frontend design skill
Going developer-focused, runtime discovery as hero. Aesthetic direction: technical brutalism — monospaced, terminal-flavored, dense with purpose. Feels like something devs built for devs, not a VC pitch deck. High contrast, code-adjacent, with one unexpected warmth element to keep it from feeling cold.


Created a file, read a file
Created a file, read a file
Dark terminal aesthetic — green-on-black, IBM Plex Mono, scanlines, cursor glow that follows your mouse. Developer energy without feeling like a GitHub readme.

What's on the page:

Hero with a live terminal demo showing the exact runtime discovery flow
4-step flow — gap detection → SwarmStore query → user auth → plugin runs
Manifest format — actual JSON example showing what a plugin looks like
Trust tiers — Verified / Community / Experimental with what each gets
Two-sided CTA — plugin builders vs. agent developers, different pitches
Waitlist form with checkboxes to segment who's applying
Drop it on Vercel as a single HTML file and you're live in minutes.

where do I host? vercel pro? vercel hobby?
what is my business model for this?
3:54 PM
Hosting: Vercel Hobby. Free, single HTML file, no backend needed yet. Upgrade only when you need custom domains on multiple projects or server-side functions. You're nowhere near that.

Business model — this is actually the more interesting question, and you have a few real options depending on which side of the marketplace you want to monetize:

Option 1: Take a cut of plugin revenue The App Store model. Plugins are free to list, but SwarmStore takes 15-30% of paid plugin transactions. Clean, scales with the ecosystem, aligns your incentives with developer success. Downside: zero revenue until paid plugins exist and get used at volume.

Option 2: Developer subscription (SaaS) Free tier to list experimental plugins, paid tier ($20-50/mo) for Verified status, analytics, priority discovery placement, and higher API rate limits. Predictable revenue, works even before consumers arrive. This is probably your fastest path to first dollar.

Option 3: Agent platform licensing Charge the agents, not the plugins. Any personal AI platform (including LUMARA) that wants to query SwarmStore pays a platform fee or per-query fee. B2B, higher ACV, fewer customers to manage. Makes sense once you have enough plugins that SwarmStore is genuinely valuable infrastructure.

Option 4: Freemium data layer Free discovery, but analytics — "your plugin was queried 4,200 times this month by agents seeking X capability" — sits behind a paid tier. Developers will pay for that signal.

Honestly for where you are right now: Option 2 gets you revenue fastest and validates whether developers see enough value to pay. You can layer in the transaction cut (Option 1) once the marketplace has liquidity. Option 3 is the eventual big prize — LUMARA becomes your first paying customer and proof point.

I don't see how to copy this into vercel?

4:29 PM
You don't need GitHub for a single HTML file. Fastest path:

Go to vercel.com/new
Scroll past the Git options — look for "Deploy without Git" or just drag and drop your HTML file directly onto the page
Done — you'll get a .vercel.app URL instantly
If you don't see the drag-drop zone, the even faster alternative:

Install Vercel CLI: npm i -g vercel
In your terminal, navigate to the folder with your swarmstore.html file
Rename it to index.html first, then run vercel
Follow the 3 prompts — live in under a minute
The CLI route is honestly faster than the UI for a single file.


Global installation of Vercel npm i -g vercel npm warn Unknown env config "devdir". This will stop working in the next major version of npm. npm error code EPERM npm error syscall mkdir npm error path /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/.vercel-zw0Ty2D2 npm error errno -1 npm error Error: EPERM: operati

The folder name ARCv2.5 is invalid for Vercel. Run this instead:

Ok deployed. Can we create a new landing page then for LUMARA? you can check out it's sigil from here and look at the updated document resposition here:

4:56 PM
I can see the reposition doc — great clarity on the messaging. Let me grab the sigil before I build.


Tabs Context

No browser connected so I can't fetch the sigil URL — can you paste the URL or upload the image directly here? Once I have it I'll build the page around it.

In the meantime I'm clear on the direction from the doc:

Lead: "Frontier AI that actually knows you — and keeps it that way"
Three pillars: Full context on your terms / Data never leaves without you / Frontier capability, no compromises
Tone: Companion, warm, private by design — not agentic, not technical
Aesthetic: Should feel different from SwarmStore — that was cold terminal green. LUMARA should feel personal, warm, considered
Drop the sigil and I'll build it.

I've added some of the main pages to help with the overall colors

5:01 PM
Perfect — got everything I need. The sigil is geometric, mandala-like, very considered. The app is dark navy/slate with indigo-violet accents. Warm but not soft — sophisticated dark UI.

Building now.


Created a file, read a file
Created a file, read a file
Dark navy/indigo — pulled directly from your app screenshots. Cormorant Garamond for the editorial warmth, Geist for the clean body text. The sigil appears four times: nav, hero (spinning with a glow pulse), quote section, and waitlist — it earns its place each time rather than being decorative noise.

What's on the page:

Hero with spinning sigil, glow breathing animation, and a phone mockup that mirrors your actual app UI
Three pillars — Context on your terms / Data never leaves / Frontier capability
Context section — live chat UI showing the opt-in flow in action
Privacy — four cards, each a specific technical guarantee not a policy claim
Quote section — the repositioned one-liner as a full-bleed moment
Waitlist — clean, minimal
One thing to fix before deploying: the sigil image path references /mnt/user-data/uploads/LUMARA_Sigil.png which works locally but not on Vercel. Put LUMARA_Sigil.png in the same folder as the HTML and change the paths to ./LUMARA_Sigil.png.

Code · HTML 
can we ustilize the same font from swarmstore landingpage for LUMARA's page?

5:08 PM
The SwarmStore page uses IBM Plex Mono. That's a pure terminal font — it'll fight LUMARA's warm, personal tone hard. I'd push back on that.

The contrast between the two pages is actually an asset. SwarmStore feels like a dev tool (it is one). LUMARA feels like something personal and considered. Same font family collapses that distinction.

That said, it's your call.

is there something we can unify then?

5:09 PM
Yeah — the right move is a shared design system token rather than the same fonts. Things that make both pages feel like they came from the same company without flattening their personalities:

Same border radius logic (both currently use sharp/minimal — good)
Same spacing rhythm (8px grid)
Same button style — currently they're slightly different, could unify
Shared accent logic — SwarmStore's green and LUMARA's indigo are both saturated single-hue accents, that's already consistent
IBM Plex Mono for labels/metadata only on LUMARA — the tiny uppercase tags, timestamps, the section-eyebrow elements. Keep Cormorant for headings, keep Geist for body. This is actually what SwarmStore does too — IBM Plex Mono for UI chrome, IBM Plex Sans for body.
That last one is the easiest win. Both pages would use IBM Plex Mono for the small technical UI text, different serifs/sans for the main content. Feels like a system, not a coincidence.

Want me to update LUMARA to use IBM Plex Mono for all the label/eyebrow/metadata text and swap Geist for IBM Plex Sans for body? Headings stay Cormorant. That gives you a unified type system across both products.

ok update all then

SwarmStore keeps its full IBM Plex Mono/Sans feel (dev tool energy). LUMARA keeps Cormorant for its warmth. But the small text — eyebrows, tags, timestamps, notes — now speaks the same language across both products.

Let me check what's happening on that page.


Tabs Context

No browser connected so I can't check the live URL directly. But the 404 error on Vercel for a single HTML file is almost always one of two things:

Most likely: the file is named lumara.html not index.html

Vercel serves index.html as the root by default. Any other filename gets a 404 at /.

Fix:

bash
mv lumara.html index.html
vercel --yes --name lumara-alpha
Second possibility: you're deploying from the wrong folder

Make sure you run vercel from inside the folder that contains the index.html, not from a parent directory.

Quick checklist:

File is named index.html ✓
Run vercel from inside that folder ✓
When Vercel asks "Output Directory", it should say . or be left blank ✓
That should be all it takes.

ok how do we implement option 2 then?

6:14 PM
You mean the developer subscription business model — paid tier for Verified status, analytics, priority placement?

To implement that you need three things:

Auth — know who the developer is
Payments — Stripe subscription
A backend — to gate features based on plan
Fastest stack to get this live:

Stripe + Supabase + Vercel Edge Functions

Supabase for auth (email/GitHub login) and storing developer/plugin records
Stripe for subscription billing ($20-50/mo)
Vercel Edge Functions for the API (same deployment as your landing page)
Want me to build this out? I'd start with:

A developer signup/dashboard page
Stripe checkout integration
Supabase auth flow
The basic data model (developers, plugins, tiers, subscriptions)
Before I do — are you comfortable with Supabase, or would you prefer a simpler approach like Stripe + Firebase or even just Stripe + Notion as a backend while you're still validating? The right answer depends on how fast you want to move vs. how much you want to build properly now.

I want to move fast on this, with how fast openclaw is moving, and how fast moltbook developed, this is only a natural extension

6:16 PM
Fast is right. Here's the leanest path that's still production-ready:

Stripe + Supabase + Vercel — but we build only what you need to take money right now:

Developer signs up (Supabase auth)
Picks a plan, pays (Stripe Checkout — no custom UI needed)
Gets access to a dashboard where they can submit a plugin for Verified review
You get notified, you review, you approve
That's it. No over-engineering. You can add analytics, discovery placement, and the actual SwarmStore API later — right now you just need to capture early developers and start billing.

Two questions before I start building:

what do you recommend?

6:17 PM
$29/mo — low enough that any serious developer doesn't think twice, high enough to signal real intent. You're not selling to enterprises yet, you're signing up early believers. $49 adds friction, $29 is a no-brainer.

Just the badge + priority review for now. Here's why: analytics requires you to actually have data flowing through SwarmStore, which doesn't exist yet. Shipping a fake analytics dashboard is tech debt and sets wrong expectations. The honest value prop right now is "we review your plugin, verify it, and it gets the Verified badge when SwarmStore launches." That's a real thing developers will pay $29 for to get ahead of the queue.

So: Free + $29/mo Verified, badge + priority review only.

You collect emails, you collect money, you build the actual marketplace with a funded waitlist. That's the move.

Ready to build?

Q: Go ahead with Free + $29/mo?
A: Yes, build it

6:19 PM

is callback url the same as project url?

7:15 PM
No, they're different things.

You can actually skip the GitHub OAuth setup for now — it's optional. You don't need it to go live. Email/password auth is enough to start.

What I can see on your screen right now is exactly what you need. Copy both of these:

Project URL — the https://hzboqpnmokhllvydknjz.supabase.co field (hit Copy)
Publishable API Key — the sb_publishable_s_4jn... field (hit Copy)
That's the anon key. Save both somewhere, then head back to your code editor and we'll drop them into signup.html and dashboard.html.

Describe Swarm Store verified.

9:49 PM
SwarmStore Verified is the paid tier ($29/mo) for plugin developers. Here's what it means:

What it is technically A trust classification that signals to AI agents and users that your plugin has been reviewed by SwarmStore before it can access personal context. Agents match their permission level against trust tiers before executing — Verified is the only tier eligible for privacy-sensitive use cases.

What you get as a developer

Your plugin goes through a full code and security review
Cryptographic signing of your manifest
The Verified badge in discovery results — agents and users can see it
Priority placement in semantic search results at launch
Priority review queue — you're not waiting behind Community submissions
Direct support access
What it means for agents querying SwarmStore When an agent searches for a capability, results are ranked by relevance and trust score. Verified plugins rank higher and are the only ones eligible to receive personal user context (like LUMARA passing journal data to a health plugin). Experimental and Community plugins get sandboxed, minimal-context access only.

The honest pitch right now SwarmStore isn't live yet — so what Verified actually buys you today is a position at the front of the queue when it does launch, and a signal that you're serious. It's an early bet, not a live product feature. That's worth being transparent about when developers ask.

clarify where to go with this:

Set up webhook:
Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint
URL: https://YOUR_VERCEL_URL/api/stripe-webhook
Events to listen for:
checkout.session.completed
customer.subscription.updated
customer.subscription.deleted
invoice.payment_failed
Copy the Webhook signing secret (starts with whsec_) ⸻
10:03 PM
You can't do the webhook step yet — you need your Vercel URL first, which you don't have until after you deploy.

Skip this step for now. Here's the correct order:

✅ Supabase — done
→ Stripe — do this next (create product, get secret key + price ID)
→ Deploy to Vercel — get your live URL
→ Come back and add the webhook using that URL
So right now, go to stripe.com, create an account if you don't have one, and:

Products → Add product
Name: SwarmStore Verified
Price: $29.00 → Recurring → Monthly
Save — copy the Price ID (starts with price_)
Developers → API keys → copy the Secret key (starts with sk_test_ in test mode)
Paste both back here when you have them and we'll move to the Vercel env vars step.

how do I deploy to vercel?

10:07 PM
You have two options depending on how you set up the project:

Option A — you have the zip file (easiest)

Unzip swarmstore.zip on your machine
Open Terminal, cd into the swarmstore folder
Run:
bash
vercel --yes --name swarmstore
Option B — deploy from GitHub (better long-term)

Push the swarmstore folder to a new GitHub repo
Go to vercel.com → Add New Project
Import that repo → hit Deploy
Before you deploy, make sure you've added the Supabase keys into signup.html and dashboard.html first — otherwise the auth won't work on the live site.

Have you done that yet, or do you still need to drop those in?

change of heart, recreate the package - keep everything but change the name to swarmspace

7:12 AM
Quick question first — just SwarmStore → SwarmSpace as a straight rename, or do you also want the messaging/copy updated to reflect the new name throughout?

I want the messaging and copy updated

7:13 AM
On it. Full rename — name, messaging, copy, everything.


Ran 2 commands
Ran 2 commands
Now update the hero copy and key messaging to feel native to "SwarmSpace" — not just a find-replace:


Update hero and key copy to feel native to SwarmSpace
Update hero and key copy to feel native to SwarmSpace
Now update the manifest code example filename and the terminal demo:


Ran 2 commands, read a file
Ran 2 commands, read a file
Done. Everything updated — name, copy, messaging — nothing feels like a find-replace job.

Key copy changes across the package:

Hero: "One space. Every agent capability."
Tagline: "The capability space for personal AI"
Plugins → capabilities throughout
Developers → builders in the who section
Discover call: swarmspace.discover() in the terminal demo
Manifest filename: oura-sync.swarmspace.json
Deploy command when you're ready:

bash
cd swarmspace
vercel --yes --name swarmspace
Swarmspace
ZIP 
file id downloaded. now what?

7:25 AM
Unzip it, then open Terminal and run:

bash
cd ~/Downloads/swarmspace
vercel --yes --name swarmspace
That's it. Paste the URL it gives you back here — then we'll go set up the Stripe webhook using that URL.

how do I push the folder to a newly created git repo?

7:29 AM
bash
# 1. Go into the folder
cd ~/Downloads/swarmspace

# 2. Initialize git
git init

# 3. Add everything
git add .

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "initial commit"

# 5. Connect to your new GitHub repo (paste your repo URL here)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/swarmspace.git

# 6. Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Replace YOUR_USERNAME/swarmspace with the actual repo URL GitHub gives you when you create it. It's shown on the empty repo page right after creation.

ok I've deployed the vercel site from the opened zip file folder contents, and I've created a repo on github from the same file folder contents how do I connect them?

7:34 AM
In your Vercel project dashboard:

Go to vercel.com → click your SwarmSpace project
Settings → Git
Click Connect Git Repository
Select GitHub → find your swarmspace repo → connect
From now on every git push to main will auto-deploy to Vercel. No more manual deploys.

bash
# Test it — make a change, then:
git add .
git commit -m "connect to vercel"
git push
Vercel will pick it up automatically.

Ok I have my strip keys. what do I do now?

7:35 AM
Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables and add these one by one:

Key	Value
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY	your sk_test_... key
STRIPE_VERIFIED_PRICE_ID	your price_... ID
SUPABASE_URL	your https://xxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY	your service role key (Supabase → Settings → API → service_role — not the anon key)
APP_URL	your Vercel URL e.g. https://swarmspace.vercel.app
Leave STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET for now — we'll add that after the webhook is set up.

Once you've added all five, hit Redeploy in Vercel (Deployments tab → the three dots on the latest deploy → Redeploy). That picks up the new env vars.

Then come back and we'll set up the Stripe webhook.

1771865416723_image.png
I'm here right now, but I cannot find the service role key.

8:50 AM
You're in the right place — Supabase is showing your 2 tables which means the SQL ran correctly.

For the service role key:

Click Settings (gear icon, bottom of left sidebar)
Click API
Scroll down to Project API keys
You'll see two keys — anon/public and service_role
Click Reveal next to service_role, then copy it
It's on the same page as your Project URL and anon key from earlier.

1771865476664_image.png
I don't see anything that says Project API keys here.

8:51 AM
Click Project Settings in the sidebar (you can see it at the bottom of the left menu in your screenshot), then click API from the submenu that appears.

1771865521513_image.png
I'm in here now, but I don't see project settings.

8:53 AM
You're already in the right place. Click API Keys in the left submenu — I can see it in your screenshot, it's right there under Project Settings.

1771865611135_image.png
where's the service role key?

8:53 AM
Supabase changed their UI. The Secret keys section at the bottom of that page is what you need — that sb_secret_f323... key is your service role key.

Click the eye icon 👁 next to it to reveal it, then copy it. That goes into Vercel as SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.

ok got it. now where do I find my app_url?

8:54 AM
That's just your Vercel deployment URL — the one Vercel gave you when you deployed. It looks like:

https://swarmspace.vercel.app

or whatever custom name you used. You can find it by going to vercel.com → click your SwarmSpace project → it's shown at the top of the project page under the project name.

ok everything is in what now/

8:58 AM
Now redeploy so Vercel picks up all the env vars:

Go to vercel.com → your SwarmSpace project
Deployments tab
Click the three dots on the latest deployment → Redeploy
Once that's done, go to your live site and test the signup flow. Then come back and we'll set up the Stripe webhook — that's the last step.

It worked, but where do signups go?

8:59 AM
Two places:

Supabase → Authentication → Users — every signup appears here with their email and signup timestamp.

Supabase → Table Editor → developers — the trigger we set up auto-creates a row here for each new user, showing their plan (defaults to free).

When someone upgrades via Stripe, the webhook updates their row in developers to plan: verified. So that table is your source of truth for who's paying.

Want to test it end to end now — sign up on the live site and make sure the row appears?

It's not working with signups....

9:02 AM
Most likely the Supabase URL and anon key aren't plugged into the HTML files yet. The code still has the placeholder values.

Open signup.html in your code editor and find these two lines near the bottom:

javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
Replace them with your actual values. Do the same in dashboard.html — same two lines near the bottom.

Then:

bash
git add .
git commit -m "add supabase keys"
git push
Vercel will auto-deploy. Try signing up again after that.

is YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY the SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

9:06 AM
No, they're different keys — don't mix them up.

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = the Publishable key (sb_publishable_s_4jn...) — safe to use in the browser, goes in signup.html and dashboard.html
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = the Secret key (sb_secret_f323...) — server-side only, goes in Vercel env vars
So in your HTML files use the publishable key, not the secret one.


dashboard.html
html


signup.html
187 lines

html

It's still not working. here are the files:

3:35 PM
I can see the keys are already in the file. The issue is likely that Supabase needs to whitelist your site's URL before it'll accept signups from it.

Go to Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration and add your Vercel URL to:

Site URL: https://swarmspace.vercel.app (or whatever your URL is)
Redirect URLs: https://swarmspace.vercel.app/**
Save, then try signing up again. That's almost certainly the issue — Supabase blocks auth requests from unlisted domains by default.

1771889896515_image.png
this looks right. But where do emails go when I sign up?

3:38 PM
That config looks correct.

For emails — Supabase sends a confirmation email to the address used to sign up. The user has to click the link in that email before they can log in.

During development this is annoying. To turn it off:

Supabase → Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Email → toggle off "Confirm email" → Save.

That way signups work instantly without email confirmation. You can turn it back on before you go fully public.

Try signing up again after disabling that.

IT's still not sending...

3:39 PM
Let me look at the actual error. Open your browser's developer console while on the signup page:

Right-click anywhere on the signup page → Inspect
Click the Console tab
Try signing up
Screenshot or paste what error appears in red
That'll tell us exactly what's failing.

1771890057051_image.png
there's no errors showing up

3:41 PM
You're on the landing page (index.html), not the signup page. The signup form is at /signup.html.

Go to:

https://swarmspace-r46c4a0db-marcyap-4350s-projects.vercel.app/signup.html
Then open the console there, try signing up, and see what error appears.

Ok it's working now. I was trying to connect the betatest list

3:42 PM
Got it — so the waitlist form on the landing page (index.html) isn't connected to anything yet. Right now it just shows a fake success message.

To actually capture those emails you have two quick options:

Option A — Supabase (already set up, 5 min) Add a waitlist table and insert emails there. Keeps everything in one place.

Option B — Mailchimp / Loops / Resend (10 min) Pipe emails directly into a mailing list tool so you can email them when you launch.

Which do you want? Supabase is fastest since it's already connected. Loops.so is worth it if you plan to send launch announcement emails — it's built for exactly this use case and free to start.

Let's do supabase. What do we do?

3:43 PM
Run this in Supabase → SQL Editor:

sql
create table public.waitlist (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  email text not null unique,
  source text default 'landing', -- 'landing' | 'signup'
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

alter table public.waitlist enable row level security;

create policy "allow_insert_waitlist" on public.waitlist
  for insert with check (true);
Hit Run, then come back and I'll update the waitlist form in index.html to actually save to that table.

Ok it's successful. now what?

3:43 PM
Now I'll update the waitlist form in index.html to save emails to Supabase. Share the current index.html file and I'll patch it.

Or if you still have it in your local swarmspace folder, just open it and find this section near the bottom:

javascript
function handleWaitlist(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
Paste that here and I'll give you the exact replacement code to drop in.


index.html
html

3:44 PM

Ran 4 commands, edited a file, read a file
Ran 4 commands, edited a file, read a file
Drop this index.html into your local swarmspace folder, replacing the existing one, then:

bash
git add .
git commit -m "connect waitlist to supabase"
git push
After it deploys, test it — submit an email on the landing page, then check Supabase → Table Editor → waitlist and you should see the row appear.
